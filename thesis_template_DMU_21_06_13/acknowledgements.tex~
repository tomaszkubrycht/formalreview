\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\label{chap:acknowledgements}

First of all I would like to thank my doctoral supervisor Professor George Smoot for not interfering with my work.

Secondly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my "Meemaw". I love you - your "Moon Pie". 

Most importantly, none of this would have been possible without the love and patience of my immediate family - my mum, Marry Cooper; my twin sister, Missy Cooper; my older brother, George Cooper Jr. and my deceased father, George, to whom I would like to express my heart-felt gratitude.

I would also like to thank my fellow colleagues from Big Bang theory - Leonard ``Leaky'' Hofstadter, Rajesh Koothrapalli, Howard Wolowitz, Penny, Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz and, last but not least, my dearest friend Amy Farrah Fowler.

I would also like to acknowledge all those anonymous software developers who participated in the developments of \textit{GNU/Linux OS} and \TeX{}/\LaTeX{}.
