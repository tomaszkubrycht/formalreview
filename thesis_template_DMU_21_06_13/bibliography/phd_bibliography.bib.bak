	 abstract = {A submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) with a working
	volume of 1.4
	
	L and a hollow fiber microfiltration membrane was used to treat a
	
	contaminated raw water supply at a short hydraulic retention time
	
	(HRT) of approximately 1 h. Filtration flux tests were conducted
	
	regularly on the membrane to determine various fouling resistances,
	
	and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron
	
	microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the biofouling development
	
	and sludge cake formation on the membrane. The experimental results
	
	demonstrate that the MBR is highly effective in drinking water treatment
	
	for the removal of organic pollutants, ammonia, and UV absorbance.
	
	During the MBR operation, the fouling materials were not uniformly
	
	distributed on the entire surface of all of the membrane fibers.
	
	The membrane was covered partially by a static sludge cake that could
	
	not be removed by the shear force of aeration, and partially by a
	
	thin sludge film that was frequently washed away by aeration turbulence.
	
	The filtration resistance coefficients were 308.4 x 10(11) m(-1)
	
	on average for the sludge cake, 32.5 x 10(11) m(-1) on average for
	
	the dynamic sludge film, and increased from 10.5 x 10(11) to 59.7
	
	x 10(11) m(-1) for the membrane pore fouling after 10 weeks of MBR
	
	operation at a filtration flux of 0.5 m3/m2 x d. Polysaccharides
	
	and other biopolymers were found to accumulate on the membrane, and
	
	hence decreased membrane permeability. More important, the adsorption
	
	of biopolymers on the membrane modified its surface property and
	
	led to easier biomass attachment and tighter sludge cake deposition,
	
	which resulted in a progressive sludge cake growth and serious membrane
	
	fouling. The sludge cake coverage on the membrane can be minimized
	
	by the separation, with adequate space, of the membrane filters,
	
	to which sufficient aeration turbulence can then be applied.},

	sludge model no. 1 (ASM1) and was applied to the membrane bioreactor
	sludge with different sludge retention times (SRTs). The unified
	theory that the distinct products from the EPS and SMP overlapped
	each other was integrated into the ASM1. Two components, five processes
	and eight parameters were newly added to set up the model. To increase
	the accuracy of model simulation, microbial kinetic parameters were
	determined by respirometry method and applied to the model instead
	of microbial kinetic constant offered in ASM1. From the respirometry
	result, both of heterotroph and autotroph showed different yield
	value, growth rate and decay rate from activated sludge. There was
	no significant effect of SRT on SMP production and the experimental
	results showed good agreement with the predicted values by the model
	simulation. With the developed unified EPS and SMP model, EPS and
	SMP production could be simulated so well that it can be applied

	is a technology being increasingly employed to enhance the quality
	of purified water, increase the productivity of existing plants,
	and build smaller, yet more effective purification processes. Barrier
	to a breakthrough of the technology is the increased operational
	cost due to fouling and membrane replacement. Simulation studies
	with rigorous process models are a powerful tool to increase the
	understanding of the process and its decisive characteristics in
	order to design optimal processes and efficient operational strategies.
	In this paper, two enhancements of existing modeling approaches are
	proposed. One is taking into account the adhesive forces between
	the particles and the membrane surface, which indeed strongly effect
	cake layer formation and back flushing efficiency. The other is assessing
	the decisive influence of particle and membrane pore size distributions
	on both cake layer formation and pore blocking and their mutual dependencies.
	Both phenomena are essential characteristics which need to be considered
	for a reliable prediction of process behavior. The model is successfully
	tested in simulation studies and compared to experimental data from
	a pilot wastewater treatment plant with submerged hollow fiber membranes.},

	over a long period under various SRT scenarios, a wide range of EPS
	and membrane fouling data is obtained. These observations provide
	sufficient evidence of the functional relationship between SRT, EPS
	and alpha. As SRT decreases, the amount of EPS bound in sludge floc
	becomes higher in the high MLSS condition (> 5,000 mg/L). The amount
	of EPS in the sludge floc has positive influence on alpha. A sigmoid
	trend between EPS and alpha is observed and the functional relationship
	obtained by dimensional analysis is consistent with the experimental
	results.},

	flow (crossflow) on membrane fouling. Results were analyzed by the
	resistance-in-series model where the reason for flux decline was
	subdivided into adsorption, concentration polarization, and reversible
	and irreversible fouling. A synthesized paper mill wastewater with
	mainly lignin and 2-chlorophenol, biological suspension (activated
	sludge), and their mixture were used as feed solutions for ultrafiltration
	(30 000 Da) and microfiltration (0.3 [mu]m) at different concentrations.
	The filtration experiments demonstrated that permeate flux declined
	faster with increasing feed concentration and membrane pore size
	and with decreasing tangential flow. The biological suspension rather
	than wastewater quality was a major cause for permeate flux decline
	in membrane bioreactors. In the absence of permeate flux, filtration
	resistance by foulants adsorption was negligible, as compared to
	total filtration resistance in the presence of permeate flux. It
	was also shown that tangential flow had almost no effect on the decline
	rate of permeate flux at pseudo steady state. Membrane cleaning results
	revealed that, in the absence of tangential flow, permeate flux decline
	was dominantly caused by reversible fouling. On the other hand, tangential
	flow caused slightly higher irreversible fouling due to higher permeation
	drag, as compared to the case of absence of tangential flow. Autopsy
	of fouled membranes suggested that the irreversible fouling layer
	was initially formed by pore blocking of small particles followed
	by strong interaction of fouling layer with mainly dissolved materials
	and by fouling layer compaction due to permeation drag.},

  abstract = {A submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) with a working volume of 1.4
	L and a hollow fiber microfiltration membrane was used to treat a
	contaminated raw water supply at a short hydraulic retention time
	(HRT) of approximately 1 h. Filtration flux tests were conducted
	regularly on the membrane to determine various fouling resistances,
	and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron
	microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the biofouling development
	and sludge cake formation on the membrane. The experimental results
	demonstrate that the MBR is highly effective in drinking water treatment
	for the removal of organic pollutants, ammonia, and UV absorbance.
	During the MBR operation, the fouling materials were not uniformly
	distributed on the entire surface of all of the membrane fibers.
	The membrane was covered partially by a static sludge cake that could
	not be removed by the shear force of aeration, and partially by a
	thin sludge film that was frequently washed away by aeration turbulence.
	The filtration resistance coefficients were 308.4 x 10(11) m(-1)
	on average for the sludge cake, 32.5 x 10(11) m(-1) on average for
	the dynamic sludge film, and increased from 10.5 x 10(11) to 59.7
	x 10(11) m(-1) for the membrane pore fouling after 10 weeks of MBR
	operation at a filtration flux of 0.5 m3/m2 x d. Polysaccharides
	and other biopolymers were found to accumulate on the membrane, and

	of biopolymers on the membrane modified its surface property and
	led to easier biomass attachment and tighter sludge cake deposition,
	which resulted in a progressive sludge cake growth and serious membrane
	fouling. The sludge cake coverage on the membrane can be minimized
	by the separation, with adequate space, of the membrane filters,

	In this study, soluble and bound EPS are operationally defined: soluble

	in floc biomass which require additional treatments for extraction.
	The two kinds of EPS extracted were characterized by their organic
	fractions, their carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents, their
	biochemical composition and their pKa and PEC (protonic exchange
	capacity) values. Organic carbon content of EPS underlined qualitative
	differences between soluble and bound EPS, which were better established
	by polysaccharide content. At pH 7, whatever the EPS considered,
	the analysis of all biosorption results showed an EPS affinity for
	metals in descending order: Cu2+ > Pb2+ > Ni2+ >> Cd2+. The study
	of EPS biosorption properties showed different behaviour for soluble
	and bound EPS depending on the metal studied. For Cu2+ (only for
	EPS A), Pb2+ and Ni2+, soluble EPS showed stronger biosorption properties
	than bound EPS. For Cd2+ and Cu2+ (case of EPS B), biosorption properties
	of the two kinds of EPS studied were close due to the weak affinity
	of Cd2+ for EPS and the different possible binding mechanisms implicated
	by the speciation of Cu2+ at pH studied. At pH 7, due to the PEC
	value and pKa, the numbers of binding dissociated sites, could be
	assumed greater for soluble EPS than for bound EPS and could explain
	in part the biosorption results obtained. We can guess that soluble
	EPS play the role of a protective barrier against toxic metals for
	the microorganisms in the activated sludge flocs.},

	Several factors are thought to influence the concentration of SMP
	and their fouling propensity in one way or the other, but findings
	are often inconsistent or even contradictory. Here, SMP loading rate
	was found to have the greatest effect on SMP elimination and thus
	on concentration in the MBR. The degree of elimination decreased
	at very low DO and low nitrate concentrations. On average, 75% of
	influent SMP were eliminated in both pilot and lab trials, with the
	elimination of polysaccharides (PS) mostly above 80%. Rejection of
	SMP components by the used membrane (PAN, 37 nm) ranged mainly from
	20% to 70% for proteins and from 75% to 100% for PS. Especially protein
	rejection decreased at higher temperatures and higher nitrification
	activity. The increased fouling rates at lower temperatures might
	therefore partly be explained by this increased rejection. Apparently,
	mainly the nitrite-oxidising community is responsible for the formation
	for smaller SMP molecules that can pass the membrane.},

	role in both sizing membrane systems and in the understanding of
	membrane fouling. Protein fouling is traditionally modeled using
	one of three classical fouling mechanisms: pore blockage, pore constriction
	or cake filtration. Here, we have developed a mathematical model
	to describe flux decline behavior during microfiltration accounting
	for all three classical fouling mechanisms. Pore constriction was
	assumed to first reduce the size of internal pores. Pore blockage
	then occurs at the top of the membrane, preventing further fouling
	to the interior structure. Finally the foulants at the top of the
	membrane form a cake, which controls the late stages of the filtration.
	The model prediction shows excellent agreement with experimental
	data for 0.25 [mu]m polystyrene microspheres filtered through 0.22
	[mu]m Isopore membranes (where pore constriction is expected to be
	minimal) as well as non-aggregated bovine serum albumin solution
	through hydrophobic Durapore membranes (where pore constriction is
	expected to dominate). The effects of different fouling mechanisms
	on the flux decline were characterized by the ratio of characteristic
	fouling times of the different mechanisms. In this way the model
	can provide additional insights into the relative importance of different
	fouling mechanisms as compared to an analysis by a single mechanism
	model or by derivative plots, and it can be used to provide important
	insights into the flux decline characteristics.},

	and industrial wastewater treatment in the last decade. The efforts
	for modelling of such wastewater treatment systems have always targeted
	either the biological processes (treatment quality target) as well
	as the various aspects of engineering (cost effective design and
	operation). The development of Activated Sludge Models (ASM) was
	an important evolution in the modelling of Conventional Activated
	Sludge (CAS) processes and their use is now very well established.
	However, although they were initially developed to describe CAS processes,
	they have simply been transferred and applied to MBR processes. Recent
	studies on MBR biological processes have reported several crucial
	specificities: medium to very high sludge retention times, high mixed

	to what extent the ASM framework is applicable to MBR processes.
	Several studies highlighting some of the aforementioned issues are

  abstract = {This review paper focuses on modelling of wastewater treatment plants
	(WWTP). White-box modelling is widely applied in this field, with
	learning, design and process optimisation as the main applications.
	The introduction of the ASM model family by the IWA task group was
	of great importance, providing researchers and practitioners with
	a standardised set of basis models. This paper introduces the nowadays
	most frequently used white-box models for description of biological
	nitrogen and phosphorus removal activated sludge processes. These
	models are mainly applicable to municipal wastewater systems, but
	can be adapted easily to specific situations such as the presence
	of industrial wastewater. Some of the main model assumptions are
	highlighted, and their implications for practical model application
	are discussed. A step-wise procedure leads from the model purpose
	definition to a calibrated WWTP model. Important steps in the procedure
	are: model purpose definition, model selection, data collection,
	data reconciliation, calibration of the model parameters and model
	unfalsification. The model purpose, defined at the beginning of the
	procedure, influences the model selection, the data collection and
	the model calibration. In the model calibration a process engineering
	approach, i.e. based on understanding of the process and the model
	structure, is needed. A calibrated WWTP model, the result of an iterative
	procedure, can usually be obtained by only modifying few model parameters,
	using the default parameter sets as a starting point. Black-box,
	stochastic grey-box and hybrid models are useful in WWTP applications
	for prediction of the influent load, for estimation of biomass activities
	and effluent quality parameters. These modelling methodologies thus
	complement the process knowledge included in white-box models with
	predictions based on data in areas where the white-box model assumptions
	are not valid or where white-box models do not provide accurate predictions.
	Artificial intelligence (AI) covers a large spectrum of methods,
	and many of them have been applied in applications related to WWTPs.
	AI methodologies and white-box models can interact in many ways;
	supervisory control systems for WWTPs are one evident application.
	Modular agent-based systems combining several AI and modelling methods
	provide a great potential. In these systems, AI methods on one hand
	can maximise the knowledge extracted from data and operator experience,
	and subsequently apply this knowledge to improve WWTP control. White-box
	models on the other hand allow evaluating scenarios based on the
	available process knowledge about the WWTP. A white-box model calibration
	tool, an AI based WWTP design tool and a knowledge representation
	tool in the WWTP domain are other potential applications where fruitful
	interactions between AI methods and white-box models could be developed.},

	presented very efficient biological wastewater degradation except

	The membrane performance is less dependent on the sludge concentration
	than the sludge retention time with the laboratory module. The membrane
	performance showed clearly better results with increasing the sludge
	retention time from 8 to 40 d. The concentration of the colloidal

  abstract = {Previous studies of protein fouling during microfiltration have shown
	significant discrepancies between filtrate flux data and predictions
	of the classical pore blockage, pore constriction, and cake filtration
	models. A new mathematical model was developed for the filtrate flux
	which accounts for initial fouling due to pore blockage and subsequent
	fouling due to the growth of a protein cake or deposit over these
	initially blocked regions. The model explicitly accounts for the
	inhomogeneity in the cake layer thickness over different regions
	of the membrane arising from the time-dependent blockage of the pore
	surface. The model was shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental
	data obtained during the stirred cell filtration of bovine serum
	albumin solutions through polycarbonate track-etched microfiltration
	membranes over the entire course of the filtration. The model provides
	a smooth transition from the pore blockage to cake filtration regimes,
	eliminating the need to use different mathematical formulations to
	describe these two phenomena. In addition, the model provides the
	first quantitative explanation for some of the unusual observations
	reported previously in investigations of protein microfiltration.
	The results provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms
	of protein fouling during microfiltration. Copyright 2000 Academic

	modifies by bacterial attachment, growth of a biofilm, and bacterial
	production of extracellular polymer. Attached cells or sorbed polymers
	may alter the metal-binding characteristics of the supporting substratum
	and influence metal partitioning. The interdependent behavior of
	toxic trace metal partitioning and biofilm development requires description
	of the interaction between cell growth with its accompanying polymer
	production and metal speciation. In this article, the first of a
	two part series, a mechanistic model is developed to describe the
	growth of a film-forming bacterium which adheres to a substratum
	through the production of extracellular biopolymers. Each bacterial
	cell was modeled as a two-component structure consisting of active
	cell mass and biopolymer. The biopolymer component was further divided
	into cell-associated and dissolved categories to distinguish which
	remained naturally bound to cell surfaces from that which did not.
	Use of this structured model permitted independent description of
	the dynamics of cell growth, and polymer production, both of which
	may influence trace metal behavior. Employing parameters obtained
	from independent experiments as well as published values, the model
	satisfactorily predicts experimental observations of bacterial growth,
	attachment and detachment, biopolymer production, and adsorption
	of polymer onto solid (glass) surfaces. The model stimulated transient
	and steady-state biofilm systems equally well. In the second article

	to make predictions of the behavior of transient and steady-state
	biofilm systems in the presence of a toxic transition metal(Pb).

  abstract = {The external nitrification (EN) biological nutrient removal (BNR)
	activated sludge (ENBNRAS) system shows considerable promise for
	full-scale implementation. As an aid for this implementation, a mathematical
	simulation model would be an invaluable tool. To develop such a model,
	a study was conducted to select the most suitable simulation model
	to serve as a starting point for further development. For this, the
	existing available simulation models for BNRAS systems are compared
	with one another and evaluated against experimental observations
	in the literature and on ENBNRAS systems. One process immediately
	apparent to be crucially important is the anoxic growth of phosphorus
	accumulating organisms (PAOs), with associated PAO denitrification
	and anoxic P uptake for polyP formation. These linked processes are
	lacking in the earlier kinetic simulation models for BNRAS systems,
	which were based on aerobic PAO growth and P uptake only, but have
	been incorporated into the more recent kinetic models. This provides
	a substantive body of information on modelling this aspect. Other
	processes of significance identified to require consideration are
	anaerobic slowly biodegradable COD (SBCOD) hydrolysis to readily
	biodegradable COD (RBCOD), and COD loss. Both processes have significant
	impact on the predicted BEPR performance. Due to the uncertainties
	associated with the mechanisms and quantification of these two processes,
	it is concluded that the most extensively validated kinetic simulation
	model should be selected for development, and that the omissions
	in this model should be addressed progressively, using the relevant
	information drawn from the existing models, the literature and observations
	on ENBNRAS systems.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses a novel approach for predicting permeate flux
	decline in constant pressure ultrafiltration of protein solutions.
	A constant pressure process is assumed to be made up of a large number
	of small, sequential, constant flux ultrafiltration steps: the flux
	decreasing due to fouling and other related factors at the end of
	each step. The advantage of this approach is that constant flux ultrafiltration
	is easier to study, characterize, and model than constant pressure
	ultrafiltration. Consequently model parameters can be obtained in
	reliable and reproducible manner. Constant pressure ultrafiltration
	is dynamic in nature since both the magnitude of osmotic back-pressure
	and the extent of membrane fouling decrease as the permeate flux
	decreases with time. The proposed model takes into consideration
	the interplay between permeate flux, concentration polarization,
	and membrane fouling. The model demonstrates that the initial rapid
	flux decline is due to a combination of concentration polarization
	and membrane fouling while during the remaining part of the process,
	the effect of concentration polarization becomes negligible. The
	model also shows that concentration polarization affects the initial
	flux decline only at higher transmembrane pressures. This model which
	was validated using experimental data is conceptually simpler than
	other available models and easy to use. In addition to its value
	as a predictive tool it would particularly be useful for deciding
	appropriate start-up conditions in ultrafiltration processes.},

	1.2 [mu]m were selected for the experiments. On the other hand, raw
	effluents generated by the power plant were first pre-filtered using
	a 0.5 mm sieve and the resultant filtrate was further used for the
	present microfiltration trials by varying transmembrane pressure
	(TMP). Differences in the filterability of the effluents by the two
	membrane configurations at variable levels of TMP were explained
	using various membrane-fouling models. The filtration resistances
	that are acting in series were calculated using Darcy's and Poiseuille's

	regeneration by adopting chemical cleaning and backflushing techniques

  abstract = {Collision and coagulation rates between microbial aggregates and small
	particles were measured for individual aggregates (1.0-2.5 mm) that
	settled through a suspension of fluorescent yellow-green (YG) particles
	(2.83 microm) placed in a settling column. The microbial aggregates,
	with an average fractal dimension of 2.26, were generated in a lab-scale
	sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and also collected from a full-scale
	activated sludge (AS) treatment system. As calculated from comparisons
	between the settling velocities observed and those predicted by Stokes'
	law for impermeable particles, the average fluid collection efficiencies
	were 0.08 for the SBR aggregates and 0.14 for the AS flocs, which
	were much lower than those previously reported for nonbiological
	aggregates of latex microspheres. The collision frequency functions
	between microbial aggregates and small YG particles were 2 orders
	of magnitude lower than predicted by the rectilinear model but 1
	order of magnitude greater than predicted by a curvilinear model.
	The overall scavenging efficiencies of suspended particles by the
	falling microbial aggregates compared well with those observed for
	the nonbiological aggregates, while the particle removal efficiencies
	from the flow internal to the microbial aggregates were 1 order of
	magnitude higher than those of the nonbiological aggregates. It is
	argued that the permeability of microbial aggregates could be reduced
	by exopolymeric material clogging the pores within the aggregates.
	The internal permeation through a bioaggregate thus may not be significant
	enough to be included in the calculation of its settling velocity;
	however, the intra-aggregate flow cannot be simply neglected where
	coagulation is concerned. Streamlines still can penetrate the interior
	of microbial aggregates, allowing greater collision frequencies with
	other particles than predicted by the curvilinear model. The narrow
	and convoluted internal flow passages resulting from the collection
	of extracellular polymeric substances may also contribute to the
	higher interior particle removal efficiencies of microbial aggregates
	than those of more permeable, nonbiological aggregates.},

  abstract = {A transient model based on the finite element method (CFD Comsol)
	to simulate numerically the flow (momentum equation) and the concentration
	(diffusion-convection equation) in an ultrafiltration unit is presented.
	The CFD model was developed by solving the 2D Navier-Stokes equation
	and the mass conservation equation for transient conditions. A resistance
	model was used to link the retained protein concentration, the feed
	and permeate velocity and the pressure at the membrane surface. The
	ultrafiltration unit consists of a hollow fiber module, a feed tank
	and a feed pump. In the hollow fiber module, the variable transmembrane
	pressure, a variable viscosity of the retentate and a polarization
	layer and a time variable cake occurring on the membrane are considered.
	Under laminar flow regime, the model allows for the predictions of
	the velocity fields, the pressure and the concentration along the
	membrane fiber. The model predictions for the transient permeate
	flux and the pressure profile in the fiber are compared to experimental
	data during the concentration of soy protein extracts in a hollow
	fiber module where total retention of the soy protein is achieved.
	The comparison shows that the proposed model fits well with the experiments
	and shows the interest to take into account the variation of resistance
	and the concentration dependant viscosity flux. The model shows that
	the transmembrane pressure is an important element on the polarization
	concentration profile and that a constant transmembrane pressure
	yields erroneous conclusion on the concentration polarization. The
	model alleviates some limitations on the polarization modeling avoiding
	the need to estimate the polarization thickness in the computation
	of the polarization resistance. The flexibility of the current model
	is only limited by the ability of the user to accurately define the
	variations of the properties of the system for industrial applications.},

	Determination of the cake layer permeability is critical for an accurate

	The cake layer permeability was derived and found to be a function

	The permeation model was applied to study the effect of mixed liquid

	(PSD) and extracelluler polymeric substance (EPS) on cake layer permeability
	in a submerged membrane bioreactor. Results showed that the permeation
	model was a useful tool to study the micromechanism of membrane fouling.
	There was a close correlation between MLSS concentration and cake
	layer permeability. There were a slight and a distinct decrease of
	the cake layer permeation as MLSS increased less and larger than
	10,000 mg/L, respectively. PSD and EPS are two significant factors

	almost all of the effluent COD from the glucose-fed chemostat. For
	shorter retention times, as low as 10 days, the SMP concentration

	from a sequencing batch reactor processing industrial waste. The
	MF unit was a hollow fibre module with gas backwash capability, and
	operated with pumped permeate (controlled flux) and dead-end, crossflow
	or intermittent feed. The results showed that crossflow had no effect
	on flux and that intermittent dead-end filtration was less productive
	than non-intermittent operation. For dead-end filtration the cycle-time
	between gas backwashes depends very significantly on the imposed
	flux (varying from about 100 min at 30 L/m2 h to about 5 min at 90
	L/m2 h) and the feed solids content. Optimal operation has to balance
	operating (energy for backwash) costs and the capital (membrane area)
	costs. Cost analysis based on capital and energy costs indicates
	that for lower energy cost the unit needs to be operated at lower
	imposed flux but to minimise total cost it is necessary to operate
	the unit above 60 L/m2 h imposed flux depending on the maximum transmembrane
	pressure (TMP) allowed before back washing. Further analysis of TMP
	profiles showed that membrane resistance increased over time towards
	a maximum, which tended to increase with imposed flux. This implies
	more frequent chemical cleaning for high flux operation. Specific
	cake resistances were deduced from the profiles and indicated cake
	compression at higher flux and larger maximum TMP. Results of long-term
	trials are also reported. Water quality analysis shows consistent
	quality of permeate regardless of operating conditions.},

	(MBR) fed with synthetic wastewater with mixed liquor suspended solids
	concentrations between 3 and 10 g/L, the solid/liquid separation
	was achieved by a tubular membrane in side stream. For longer sustainable
	flux, air sparging was supplied to fight external fouling with the
	scouring effect of slug flow. Additional to that, backflushing was
	provided as a technique against internal fouling. The combination
	of both techniques showed very promising results and was superior
	to the operation of only one flux enhancement technique, yielding
	about three times higher fluxes compared to the NON-enhanced application
	after continuous filtration for 8 days. Backflushing accomplished
	significant flux increases with minimal product loss. The flux ratio
	of enhanced flux versus non-enhanced flux increased linearly with
	filtration time and air injection ratio. A simple model was developed
	to describe the development of the flux ratio over time for different
	air injection ratios. At high mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations
	(MLSS), where a high fouling potential exists, the combination of
	air sparging and back flushing was particularly effective in increasing
	the flux compared to non-enhanced filtration. Dimensionless fouling
	numbers increased with time, especially for lower air injection ratios.},

  abstract = {The activated sludge process generates an endogenous residue (XE)
	as a result of heterotrophic biomass decay (XH). A literature review
	yielded limited information on the differences between XE and XH
	in terms of chemical composition and content of extracellular polymeric
	substances (EPS). The objective of this project was to characterize
	the chemical composition (x, y, z, a, b and c in CxHyOzNaPbSc) of
	the endogenous and the active fractions and EPS of activated sludge
	from well designed experiments. To isolate XH and XE in this study,
	activated sludge was generated in a 200\&\#xa0;L pilot-scale aerobic
	membrane bioreactor (MBR) fed with a soluble and completely biodegradable
	synthetic influent of sodium acetate as the sole carbon source. This
	influent, which contained no influent unbiodegradable organic or

	composed essentially of two fractions: heterotrophic biomass XH and
	an endogenous residue XE, the nitrifying biomass being negligible.
	The endogenous decay rate and the active biomass fraction of the
	MBR sludge were determined in 21-day aerobic digestion batch tests
	by monitoring the VSS and OUR responses. Fractions of XH and XE were
	respectively 68% and 32% in run 1 (MBR at 5.2 day SRT) and 59% and
	41% in run 2 (MBR at 10.4 day SRT). The endogenous residue was isolated
	by subjecting the MBR sludge to prolonged aerobic batch digestion
	for 3 weeks, and was characterized in terms of (a) elemental analysis
	for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur; and (b) content of
	EPS. The MBR sludge was characterized using the same procedures (a
	and b). Knowing the proportions of XH and XE in this sludge, it was
	possible to characterize XH by back calculation. Results from this
	investigation showed that the endogenous residue had a chemical composition
	different from that of the active biomass with a lower content of
	inorganic matter (1:4.2), of nitrogen (1:2.9), of phosphorus (1:5.3)
	and of sulphur (1:3.2) but a similar content of carbon (1:0.98).
	Based on these elemental analyses, chemical composition formulae
	for XH and XE were determined as CH1.240O0.375N0.200P0.0172S0.0070
	and CH1.248O0.492N0.068P0.0032S0.0016, respectively. Data from EPS
	analyses also confirmed this difference in structure between XE and
	XH with an EPS content of 11--17% in XE versus 26--40% in XH.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model was developed on the basis of population balances
	to predict the floc size distribution in a coagulating suspension.
	The coagulation process is performed in a stirred tank reactor with
	a turbulent flow field. In the population model the influence of
	the different local energy charges inside the reactor is taken into
	account. Moreover two sorts of particles are distinguished, i.e.
	the originally present and completely dispersed primary particles
	and the flocs. Contrary to the primary particles the flocs can be
	disrupted due to pressure and shear forces as they are mechanically
	not very stable. This different behaviour requires separate population
	balances for the two sorts of particles. The model parameters that
	are necessary are adapted to one single experiment. For the steady
	state the results represent different floc size distributions dependent
	on the solid concentration and the energy charge. Moreover it is
	shown that the assumption of an ideally mixed reactor that is often
	used cannot be maintained to be always true for the prediction of
	the resulting floc size distribution. The calculation results achieved
	are validated by image processing measurements of coagulating quartz
	particles in an aqueous suspension.},

	membranes of nominal pore sizes 2 and 0.2 [mu]m. Permeability reduction
	is continuously evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
	image analysis are used to determine membrane pore size and particle
	size distributions. For simulation purposes, the membrane pore space
	is represented by a bundle of nonintersecting tubes. Pore segments
	in the model membranes have circular cross-sections, random locations
	and sizes distributed according to distributions determined experimentally.
	Monte Carlo simulations of cross-flow microfiltration of a well-characterized
	particle suspension on well-defined model membranes are presented
	and permeability reduction calculated. Particle capture and size
	exclusion at pore segments are considered the dominant mechanisms
	of membrane fouling. In the simulations a matching size criterion
	between pore size and particle size is used to define pore blocking.
	Simulation results accord with those obtained experimentally. Permeability
	decreases more rapidly at higher particle concentrations. For all
	particle concentrations, permeability reduction of the thinner pore
	membrane is more intense. Membrane permeability scales linearly with
	porosity in both cases of membranes. This result is discussed in
	the light of simple theoretical arguments.},

  abstract = {Modelling activated sludge systems has gained an increasing momentum
	after the introduction of activated sludge models (ASMs) in 1987.
	Application of dynamic models for full-scale systems requires essentially
	a calibration of the chosen ASM to the case under study. Numerous
	full-scale model applications have been performed so far which were
	mostly based on ad hoc approaches and expert knowledge. Further,
	each modelling study has followed a different calibration approach:
	e.g. different influent wastewater characterization methods, different
	kinetic parameter estimation methods, different selection of parameters
	to be calibrated, different priorities within the calibration steps,
	etc. In short, there was no standard approach in performing the calibration
	study, which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to (1) compare
	different calibrations of ASMs with each other and (2) perform internal
	quality checks for each calibration study. To address these concerns,
	systematic calibration protocols have recently been proposed to bring
	guidance to the modeling of activated sludge systems and in particular
	to the calibration of full-scale models. In this contribution four
	existing calibration approaches (BIOMATH, HSG, STOWA and WERF) will
	be critically discussed using a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,
	Threats) analysis. It will also be assessed in what way these approaches
	can be further developed in view of further improving the quality
	of ASM calibration. In this respect, the potential of automating
	some steps of the calibration procedure by use of mathematical algorithms
	is highlighted.},

	with very low computation time. Therefore, this model is a valuable
	tool in a risk assessment environment (designed for the evaluation
	of wastewater treatment plants facing stricter effluent norms) as
	well as in on-line (MPC) control strategies. The complexity reduction
	procedure consists of four steps. In the first step representative
	input/output data sets are generated by simulating the full ASM1
	model. In the second step the ASM1 model is rewritten in state space
	format with linear approximations of the nonlinear (kinetic) terms.
	In the third step the unknown parameters in the linear terms are
	identified based on the generated input/output data. To reduce the
	amount of parameter sets that have to be identified (to cover the
	full operation range of the plant), a Multi-Model interpolation procedure
	is introduced as a last step.},

	FT-IR analysis confirmed the presence of proteins and carbohydrates
	in the bound EPS. The organic substances with fluorescence characteristics
	in the bound EPS were identified as proteins, visible humic acid-like
	substances and fulvic acid-like substances by EEM technology. GFC
	analysis demonstrated that EPS had part of higher MW molecules and
	a broader MW distribution than the influent wastewater. It was also
	found that a high shear stress imposed on mixed liquor could result
	in the release of EPS, which would in turn influence membrane fouling
	in MBRs. Bound EPS solution was observed to have a stronger potential
	of fouling than mixed liquor. During long-term operation of the MBR,
	bound EPS demonstrated positive correlations with membrane fouling
	while temperature was verified as a negative factor affecting EPS
	concentration. Compared to tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS), loosely bound
	EPS (LB-EPS) showed more significant correlations with membrane fouling.
	This critical investigation would contribute towards a better understanding
	of the behavior, composition and fouling potential of EPS in MBR

	harvesting step which involves separation of cells, cell debris and

	is used to separate the particulate matter from the suspending medium.
	The efficiency of this microfiltration step is often improved by
	increasing the particle size through flocculation prior to microfiltration.
	Here flocculation of yeast suspensions using a cationic polyelectrolyte
	has been investigated. A self-similar steady state floc size distribution
	is obtained experimentally. The experimental results may be modeled
	using a population balance approach. The dimensionless floc size
	distribution is found to be independent of the particulate volume
	fraction, initial particle size and shear rate during flocculation
	for the ranges of these variables considered. However, the actual
	floc size distribution does depend upon these parameters. In addition,
	the approach to the self-similar steady state floc size distribution
	depends upon the particulate volume fraction. At higher particulate
	volume fractions, the volume average floc size is found to increase
	during flocculation, pass through a maximum and then decrease to
	the final steady state value. However, at lower particle volume fractions,
	a maximum in the volume average floc size is not observed. Flocculation
	of cells leads to an increase in the volume average particle diameter.
	However, it also leads to a broadening of the particle size distribution.
	Consequently, when determining the improvement in permeate flux for
	tangential flow microfiltration, it is essential to include the effects
	of an increased average particle diameter and a broadened particle
	size distribution.},

  abstract = {In a membrane bioreactor (MBR), the tangential flow along the membrane
	creates significant shear stresses. The purpose of this research
	consists in underlining the role of these shear stresses in the granulometric
	distribution of a biological suspension and in the mechanisms of
	membrane fouling. The role of the different classes of organic particles
	(settleable, supracolloidal-colloidal, soluble) in membrane fouling
	is quantified. The laboratory-scale reactor consists of an MBR composed
	of a pressurizing fermenter associated with a microfiltration module.
	The activated sludge is recirculated inside the MBR. During this
	recirculation under different linear velocities, several samples
	of the suspension are taken off and granulometric analyses and dead-end
	filtration tests are carried out. The results show that the recirculation
	induces a modification of the granulometric distribution of the particle
	size. This change, related to the destructuring of the floc and to
	the high amount of microflocs, is characterized by a decrease in
	the settleable fraction and, consequently, by an increase in the
	non-settleable fraction. Dead-end filtrations of different types
	of suspension (flocculated and recirculated) show that the shear
	stresses imposed on the suspension can modify its filterability.
	Hydraulic resistances obtained for recirculated suspensions are greater
	than those obtained for flocculated suspensions. Next, the role in
	the membrane fouling of the three main families of particles (settleable,
	supracolloidal-colloidal and soluble) is quantified by cross-flow
	filtrations during MBR operations. The results reveal the significant
	role of the soluble fraction on membrane permeability: in our operating
	conditions, half of the total resistance could be due to the soluble
	compounds. It seems that these different soluble products and their
	interaction with the membrane material play a major role in the fouling
	mechanism.},

	concentrations and four different aeration velocities at each MLSS

	of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and soluble microbial
	products (SMP) increased with increasing MLSS concentrations. The
	distribution of particle sizes shifted toward smaller particles and
	mean particle size decreased as the MLSS concentrations increased.
	Carbohydrate fractions of both EPS and SMP contributed to fouling
	more than protein fractions. The impact of flux on fouling rate was
	small as long as the operating flux was less than critical flux,
	a trend found independent of MLSS concentration. Aeration velocity
	exhibited positive impacts on fouling control at all MLSS concentrations;
	however, the degree of this impact decreased significantly with increasing
	MLSS concentrations. Increasing MLSS concentration significantly
	decreased permeability values and increased fouling rates at each
	flux tested, a trend consistent for all aeration velocities. It was
	concluded that membrane fouling was affected by a combination of
	factors including operating flux (beyond the critical flux), MLSS
	concentration (thus the concentrations of both carbohydrate and protein
	fractions of EPS) and aeration intensity.},
