	of the modeling results obtained with ASM3 and ASM1 is performed
	and it highlights the importance of considering the process of storage
	of organic substrate, including MPs, as a prior step to bacterial
	growth. In addition to the suspended solids and microorganisms, various
	soluble organic substances, which might be either undecomposed organic
	substances contained in the raw water or MPs, are assumed to be selectively
	retained within the bioreactor. The results show that the carbonaceous
	materials are more accurately estimated by ASM3, while ASM1 performs
	slightly better than ASM3 in the estimation of nitrate. The estimated
	MP concentration in the mixed liquor and permeate agrees with the
	experimental evidence, and as expected, MPs play a role in supplying
	organic substrate to heterotrophs in both ASM1 and ASM3.},

  abstract = {This study involves the microfiltration (MF) of secondary effluent
	from a sequencing batch reactor processing industrial waste. The
	MF unit was a hollow fibre module with gas backwash capability, and
	operated with pumped permeate (controlled flux) and dead-end, crossflow
	or intermittent feed. The results showed that crossflow had no effect
	on flux and that intermittent dead-end filtration was less productive
	than non-intermittent operation. For dead-end filtration the cycle-time
	between gas backwashes depends very significantly on the imposed
	flux (varying from about 100 min at 30 L/m2 h to about 5 min at 90
	L/m2 h) and the feed solids content. Optimal operation has to balance
	operating (energy for backwash) costs and the capital (membrane area)
	costs. Cost analysis based on capital and energy costs indicates
	that for lower energy cost the unit needs to be operated at lower
	imposed flux but to minimise total cost it is necessary to operate
	the unit above 60 L/m2 h imposed flux depending on the maximum transmembrane
	pressure (TMP) allowed before back washing. Further analysis of TMP
	profiles showed that membrane resistance increased over time towards
	a maximum, which tended to increase with imposed flux. This implies
	more frequent chemical cleaning for high flux operation. Specific
	cake resistances were deduced from the profiles and indicated cake
	compression at higher flux and larger maximum TMP. Results of long-term
	trials are also reported. Water quality analysis shows consistent
	quality of permeate regardless of operating conditions.},

  title = {Characterization of the heterotrophic biomass and the endogenous
	residue of activated sludge},
  journal = {Water Research},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {46},
  pages = {653--668},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {The activated sludge process generates an endogenous residue (XE)
	as a result of heterotrophic biomass decay (XH). A literature review
	yielded limited information on the differences between XE and XH
	in terms of chemical composition and content of extracellular polymeric
	substances (EPS). The objective of this project was to characterize
	the chemical composition (x, y, z, a, b and c in CxHyOzNaPbSc) of
	the endogenous and the active fractions and EPS of activated sludge
	from well designed experiments. To isolate XH and XE in this study,
	activated sludge was generated in a 200\&\#xa0;L pilot-scale aerobic
	membrane bioreactor (MBR) fed with a soluble and completely biodegradable
	synthetic influent of sodium acetate as the sole carbon source. This
	influent, which contained no influent unbiodegradable organic or
	inorganic particulate matter, allowed the generation of a sludge
	composed essentially of two fractions: heterotrophic biomass XH and
	an endogenous residue XE, the nitrifying biomass being negligible.
	The endogenous decay rate and the active biomass fraction of the
	MBR sludge were determined in 21-day aerobic digestion batch tests
	by monitoring the VSS and OUR responses. Fractions of XH and XE were
	respectively 68% and 32% in run 1 (MBR at 5.2 day SRT) and 59% and
	41% in run 2 (MBR at 10.4 day SRT). The endogenous residue was isolated
	by subjecting the MBR sludge to prolonged aerobic batch digestion
	for 3 weeks, and was characterized in terms of (a) elemental analysis
	for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur; and (b) content of
	EPS. The MBR sludge was characterized using the same procedures (a
	and b). Knowing the proportions of XH and XE in this sludge, it was
	possible to characterize XH by back calculation. Results from this
	investigation showed that the endogenous residue had a chemical composition
	different from that of the active biomass with a lower content of
	inorganic matter (1:4.2), of nitrogen (1:2.9), of phosphorus (1:5.3)
	and of sulphur (1:3.2) but a similar content of carbon (1:0.98).
	Based on these elemental analyses, chemical composition formulae
	for XH and XE were determined as CH1.240O0.375N0.200P0.0172S0.0070
	and CH1.248O0.492N0.068P0.0032S0.0016, respectively. Data from EPS
	analyses also confirmed this difference in structure between XE and
	XH with an EPS content of 11--17% in XE versus 26--40% in XH.},
