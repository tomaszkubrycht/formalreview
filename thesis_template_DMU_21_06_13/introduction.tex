\label{sec:introduction}
Water is the foundation of our modern civilization. One of the most important aspect of human existence is efficient and sustainable delivery of water to human habitat. A great example is the famous Roman aqueducts, which demonstartes the effort done for effective water supply in urban areas. Nowadays it has been issued in the Resolution 64/292 of General Assembly of the United Nation which states that "the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation is a human right essential to the full enjoyment of life and employment of all human rights."
